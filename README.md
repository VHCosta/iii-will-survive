## (i will) Survive  [Hackathon project]


This game was developed as a challenge for the "Hackathon" event at <Academia de Código_>, and consisted of creating an app/web service/game in 24 hours, based on a song we were drafted. We got assigned “I Will Survive” by Gloria Gaynor. 
We decided on making a simple game, with a story presentation shown in a comic book style.
The game tells the story of i (named after looking like the letter ‘i’), who is going against his biggest enemy, Fear itself, in an Epic Battle of Rock-Paper-Scissors. 

We used ScrollMagic, a JavaScript library providing animations on scroll, to dynamically reveal the story as you go through the page.
